(The events are in chronological order, latest first)

September 9 1999:
	- Added the Color page, with two color sampling schemes and

	- Renamed buffer in sizemap.c (it was also declared in orientmap.c)

August 23 1999:
	- Released 0.99.5
	- Added the missing Shadow controls
	- Fixed the applybrush() function. (It was foobar with regards to
	  shadow handling.) It's still shaky when using Tilable, though...

August 20 1999:
	- Applied a patch that Miod Vallat sent me, to (hopefully)
	  get rid of some warnings when compiling on 64-bits platforms.

	- Added description field to the Presets, and added a few
	  descriptions the them as well.
	- Applied a patch that Tor Lillqvist sent me to improve
	  portability to Win32. Also, config.h was added.
	- Tidied up the Sizemap dialog
	- Bugfix for Adaptive selections

July 29 1999:
	- Released 0.99.3b
	- Added the missing .ppm files to the tarballs. Sorry!

July 28 1999:
	- Released 0.99.3
	- Fixed some minor GTK compatibility issues
	- Finished Size dialog!
	- Un-adaptive algorithm removed completely. (It was not very
	  useful, and it complicated things.)

	- Added a small OS/2 test in main()
	- Started adding variable brush sizes
	- Density-correction when using shadows

	- Added a Save button for layers!
	- Added a "None" item in the layer menu
	- Fixed some tiny layout issues

	  and Noah Davis. Thanks a lot, guys. :)

February 7 1999:
	- Progress-update on Preview-button.

February 6 1999:

	  can still read the old ones, though, so you can convert by

	- Martin Weber sent me 36(!) new brushes! Thanks! :)
	- Fixed some gtk_scrolled_window() stuff for GTK-1.1.x

	- Added a few missing #includes that could cause warnings
	- Added "Centerize" under Placement
	- Fixed 'repaint.c' to use g_list_nth(xxx)->data instead of
