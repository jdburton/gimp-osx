<!-- ##### MACRO GIMP_MIN_IMAGE_SIZE ##### -->
<para>
The minimum width and height of a GIMP image in pixels.
</para>



<!-- ##### MACRO GIMP_MAX_IMAGE_SIZE ##### -->
<para>
The maximum width and height of a GIMP image in pixels. This is a
somewhat arbitray value that can be used when an upper value for pixel
sizes is needed; for example to give a spin button an upper limit.
</para>



<!-- ##### MACRO GIMP_MIN_RESOLUTION ##### -->
<para>
The minimum resolution of a GIMP image in pixels per inch. This is a
somewhat arbitray value that can be used to when a lower value for a
resolution is needed. GIMP will not accept resolutions smaller than
this value.
</para>



<!-- ##### MACRO GIMP_MAX_RESOLUTION ##### -->
<para>
The maximum resolution of a GIMP image in pixels per inch. This is a
somewhat arbitray value that can be used to when an upper value for a
resolution is needed. GIMP will not accept resolutions larger than
this value.
</para>



<!-- ##### MACRO GIMP_MAX_MEMSIZE ##### -->
<para>
A large but arbitrary value that can be used when an upper limit for a
memory size (in bytes) is needed. It is smaller than %G_MAXDOUBLE since
the #GimpMemsizeEntry doesn't handle larger values.
</para>
