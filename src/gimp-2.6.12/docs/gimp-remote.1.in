.TH GIMP-REMOTE 1 "Januar 23 2007" "Version @GIMP_VERSION@" "GIMP Manual Pages"

.SH NAME
gimp\-remote - tells a running GIMP to open a (local or remote) image file.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gimp-remote
[\-h] [\-\-help] [-v] [\-\-version] [\-\-display \fIdisplay\fP]
[\-e] [\-\-existing] [\-q] [\-\-query]  [\-s] [\-\-no\-splash]
[\-p] [\-\-print\-xid]
\fIfilename\fP ...


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fIgimp-remote\fP is a small utility that tells a running GIMP to open
one or more (local or remote) image files.  It does so by searching
for a GIMP toolbox on the active display.  If it can find a GIMP
toolbox, a synthetic drop event is created which makes GIMP think the
files would have been dropped onto the toolbox. More than one filename
or URL can be specified on the commandline. 

.PP
If no GIMP window is found, \fIgimp-remote\fP will start a new GIMP
instance and ask it to load the specified images. If no filename or
URL is given, \fIgimp-remote\fP will start a new GIMP. This behaviour
can be altered using the command-line options described below.

.PP
If you are using GIMP on Linux or another platform with the D-Bus
message bus system, chances are good that this functionality is
already built into the main GIMP executable and that you will not need
to use \fIgimp-remote\fP.
