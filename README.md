gimp-osx
========

Port of Gnu Image Manipulation Program (Gimp) to Mac OS X with full Mac integration.

This is the latest version of the Gimp complied using the Quartz version of GTK. This does not 
require an X11 installation, making the application more "Mac like" and easier to distribute. You
can find more information about gtk-osx at: http://live.gnome.org/GTK%2B/OSX/Building

This distribution includes the Gimp.app application bundle and the files used to make it. The 
application itself is a very "vanilla" Gimp that was compiled with the jhbuild tools used to compile
gtk-osx. 

It also includes the gtk-mac-bundler files used to create the application.

The binary application is located at App/Gimp.app.zip
